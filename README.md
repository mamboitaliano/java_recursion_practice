# java_recursion_practice

Simple Java recursion practice. 

[RecursionArray](RecursionArray.java) 
simply prints a 4 by 4 matrix of random numbers using recursion. 

[RecursiveMatrix](RecursiveMatrix.java) 
takes in a positive integer as input. That integer is used to specify the length - in asterisks - of the ajacent sides of two superimposed right triangles. The number of asterisks per line is decremented by one during each recursion, then incremented by one during the second for-loop.
